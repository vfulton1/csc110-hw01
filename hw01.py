def main():
    """
    This is a Docstring for the main function. This is the short description.

    Here, after a blank line, you can add a longer paragraph description.
    Docstrings are like long comments that we put right under the function definition.
    The Docstring goes from one set of "opening" three double-quotes to
    another set of "closing" three double-quotes. We also try to keep the lines short.
    The Docstring has 4 sections:
      - the short one-line description
      - the paragraph description
      - the Params section that indicates input parameters and return values
      - the "how to run" section called "Example Use".

    PARAMS:
        - None. If the function took an input int of "apples" called num, we would
                indicate it like this: - num: int with number of apples
    RETURNS:
        - None. If the function returned something (like the integer half of num),
                we would indicate it like this: int : integer half of num
